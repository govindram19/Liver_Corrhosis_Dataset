# Liver_Corrhosis_Dataset

Project assigned as a part of my internship under Prof. Saptarshi Bej (sbej7042@iisertvm.ac.in). The following tasks were assigned :

Step 1: Download the Liver Cirrhosis dataset from Kaggle (link attached) Step 2: Perform necessary pre-processing Step 3: Perform a dimension reduction (to 2 dimensions) on the dataset using the UMAP algorithm. Step 4: Extract clusters using DBSCAN from the 2 dimensional embedding, such that each cluster has at least 30 data points (a cluster with less than 30 data points must be regarded as noise). Plot the distribution of the clusters (which cluster has how many data points) to ensure that each has at least 30 data points. Step 5: Calculate the Silhouette score for your clustering distribution. Step 6: You will be evaluated by the function: min{10, number of clusters+10*Silhouette score}.
